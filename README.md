# FCar-Company-Rental-System
The project, "FCar Company Rental System," aimed to develop a user-friendly interface for a car rental system using JavaFX. The system allowed users to manage customer and car information, including adding, updating, and deleting records. The main UI window provided options to choose between customer, car, or rental management. The customer and car UI windows facilitated easy data manipulation, while the rental UI window enabled users to rent cars for specific customers. The project emphasized the use of files for permanent data storage and featured confirmation messages for critical actions like deletion. The team provided screenshots and guidelines for the GUI design, ensuring a user-friendly and intuitive experience.
