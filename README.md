# FCar-Company-Rental-System
The project, "FCar Company Rental System," aimed to modernize the car rental process for FCars, a rental company in Qatar, by developing a computerized system. The system facilitated adding, updating, and deleting customer and car information, as well as managing rentals. It included customer and car UI windows, with features for residents and visitors, and generated invoices for payments and damages. The team utilized JavaFX to create a user-friendly interface, with data permanently stored in files. The project emphasized the importance of data security and provided guidelines for the GUI design, ensuring a seamless user experience.
